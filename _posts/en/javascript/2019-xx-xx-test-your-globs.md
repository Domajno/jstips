Have you ever wondered whether you got your glob pattern right?


[globster.xyz](globster.xyz) is a tool to test and visualise glob pattern matching.
Type your glob pattern in the input field above and all matched files
will be highlighted in blue in the tree directory structure. Use it
to debug when your glob does not work or to experiment and learn from
the provided examples. It uses minimatch (version 3.0.4) under the hood.
